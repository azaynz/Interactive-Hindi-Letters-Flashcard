# Interactive Hindi Letters Flashcard
Learning the Hindi alphabet (वर्णमाला) can be challenging for beginners, especially for non-native speakers who struggle with pronunciation, letter recognition, and contextual usage. Traditional learning methods, such as textbooks, lack interactivity and native pronunciation support, making the process less engaging and effective.

To solve this, A Hindi Letter Practice with Native TTS provides an interactive digital learning experience. Users can hover over flashcards to reveal Hindi letters and click on them to hear their correct pronunciation with native text-to-speech (TTS). Each letter is accompanied by an example sentence and its English translation to enhance contextual understanding. The tool is designed with an intuitive interface, Devanagari script-friendly fonts, and responsive design for seamless use on different devices.

This approach makes learning Hindi more interactive, engaging, and effective. Users can practice at their own pace, reinforce pronunciation with native audio, and build confidence in reading and understanding Hindi letters. Whether you're a beginner or someone looking to refine your Hindi skills, this tool simplifies the learning process while making it enjoyable.
